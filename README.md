#WDI Project 1
##TicTacToe - OOP

### Technologies Used
Over the last two weeks, my cohorts and I were bombarded with tons of information on various tools, logic, methods, and patterns.

I mainly worked in **Javascript**, emphasizing the use of **jQuery**.

This project focuses on the principles of **object-oriented programming** using all the **front-end web tools** we have developed.

###Existing features
Like the standard game of tic-tac-toe that can be done on paper. The game can:
- switch players
- display a winner or tie
  - keep track of scores for both players or ties
- reset the board
- some css hover transforms

###Planned features
- Create a expand effect for my `overlays`
- Undo
  - Undo 1 move
  - Undo all moves of that game instance
- Make the cell flip into the z-axis (3d-like)
- Allow for user to input a `team` name
